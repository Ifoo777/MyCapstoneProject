# MyCapstoneProject Recipe Website


## What this is and what this project is for.
I created a website project to show case different kinds of recipes using HTML, SCSS and Javascript as well as JQuery functionality
What this project does is that it allows a user to browse through the site and like recipes a comment and contact page section also save specific items on the page and the saved items will be displayed on the saved for later page.

If you do not have Git installed on your local machine you can simply click on the ‘code’ button and there will be an option to download Zip file as seen in the screenshot above. Download the folder and extract all files. Now all the files are on your local machine

If you do have Git installed you can click on the ‘code’ button as well and simply select to copy the HTTPS URL link as seen in figure 1.1 above. Now open the Git command line and type in “got clone” and past the copied repo URL and press enter. The files are now downloaded/installed onto your local machine

With the code files on your machine now open up the files in the code editor of your choice. If your using vscode and are not sure where to go to select the folder or file, have a look at the example below in the image which shows the open folder tab to open a file or folder:

once you have opened the folder and have the files displaying on you vscode side bar you should install live server as seen in the image below
